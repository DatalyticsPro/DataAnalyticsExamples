The following is a description of: PRODUCER PRICE INDEX-Current Commodity Series (WP)

Survey Description:  About 10,000 PPIs for individual products and groups of products
are released each month. PPIs are available for the output of nearly all industries in
the goods-producing sectors of the U.S. economy--mining, manufacturing, agriculture, 
fishing, and forestry--as well as natural gas, electricity, construction, and goods
competitive with those made in the producing sectors, such as waste and scrap materials. 
The PPI program covers approximately 72 percent of the service sector's output, as 
measured by revenue reported in the 2007 Economic Census. Data includes industries in the
following sectors: wholesale and retail trade; transportation and warehousing; information;
finance and insurance; real estate brokering, rental, and leasing; professional, scientific,
and technical services; administrative, support, and waste management services; health care
and social assistance; and accommodation.

To the extent possible, prices used in constructing the indexes are the 
actual revenue or net transaction prices producers receive for sales of
their outputs.  Scientific (probability) sampling techniques are 
used to select reporting establishments, products, and transactions for all
types and volumes of output (not just volume-sellers).

The commodity classification structure of the PPI organizes products by 
similarity of end use or material composition, regardless of whether the 
products are classified as primary or secondary in their industry of origin. 
This system is unique to the PPI and does not match any other standard coding 
structure. The commodity classification system is organized as a hierarchical 
structure that starts with major commodity groupings (2-digit level of aggregation). 
Each major commodity grouping includes (in descending order of aggregation) 
subgroups (3-digit level), product classes (4-digit level), subproduct classes 
(5- and 6-digit level), item groupings (7-digit level), and individual items 
(8-, 9-, and 10-digit levels). Commodity-based FD-ID price indexes regroup 
commodities at the subproduct class (six-digit) level, according to the class 
of buyer and the amount of physical processing or assembling the products have 
undergone. Commodity-based Inputs to Industries indexes regroup commodities to form
indexes for the net input to industry production (excluding capital investment,
labor, and imports).

Summary Data Available: More than 4,000 commodity price indexes organized by 
product, service, and end use. Indexes by Final Demand-Intermediate Demand (FD-ID), 
Inputs to Industries, and by durability of product (8 series) are also available, 
some back to 1947.

In addition, data are available for major (2-digit) commodity groupings.

Seasonally adjusted data are available for about 360 commodity indexes.

Frequency of Observations:  Monthly.

Annual Averages:  Annual averages are available for all series which 
published each month of the year and are unadjusted for seasonality.

Data Characteristics:  All indexes are stored with one decimal place.

Updating Schedule:  Updates are made near the middle of the month 
following a given reference month. Data are subject to revision four months 
after their original publication. For example, January index data are made 
available in February and revised January data are published in June when May 
data is released. Semi-annual changes also result in adding, deleting, or
re-coding of indexes which results in some indexes moving from the WP to the
WD database when they become discontinued.

Section 3
=================================================================================
The definition of a time series, its relationship to and the interrelationship
among series, data and mapping files is detailed below:

A time series refers to a set of data observed over an extended period of time
over consistent time intervals (i.e. monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, annually).  
BLS time series data are typically produced at monthly intervals and represent data 
ranging from a specific consumer item in a specific geographical area whose price 
is gathered monthly to a category of worker in a specific industry whose employment
rate is being recorded monthly, etc.

The files are organized such that data users are provided with the following
set of files to use in their efforts to interpret data files:

a)  a series file (only one series file per survey)
b)  mapping files
c)  data files

The series file contains a set of codes which, together, compose a series 
identification code that serves to uniquely identify a single time series.  
Additionally, the series file also contains the following series-level information:

a) the period and year corresponding to the first data observation 
b) the period and year corresponding to the most recent data observation. 

The mapping files are definition files that contain explanatory text descriptions
that correspond to each of the various codes contained within each series
identification code.

The data file contains one line of data for each observation period pertaining to a
specific time series.  Each line contains a reference to the following:

a) a series identification code
b) year in which data is observed
c) period for which data is observed (M13, Q05, and S03 indicate annual averages)
d) value
e) footnote code (if available)

File Structure and Format: The following represents the file format used to define 
wp.series.  Note that the Field Numbers are for reference only; they do not exist 
in the database.  Data files are in ASCII text format.  Data elements are separated 
by tabs; the first record of each file contains the column headers for the data
elements stored in each field.  Each record ends with a new line character. 

Field #/Data Element	Length		Value(Example)		

1.  series_id		  30		WPS00000000

2.  group_code		  3		01

File Structure and Format: The following represents the file format used to define
each data file.  Note that the field numbers are for reference only; they do not 
exist in the database.  Data files are in ASCII text format.  Data elements are 
separated by spaces; the first record of each file contains the column headers for 
the data elements stored in each field.  Each record ends with a new line character.  

The wp.data file is partitioned into a number of separate files:  See Section 2

The above-referenced data files have the following format:

Field #/Data Element	Length		Value(Example)
